- Find the y-axis label on the chart
- Use move_to_element & horizontal move_by_offset to hover over the chart and generate the tooltip
- I just took some guesses and found that jumping with offset 7 generates all the tooltips in one go without doubles or missing any. 
- The website also refreshes the chart so I catch exceptions for that to reset everything and continue again. 
- Then after 107 datapoints, hit previous page and restart!
